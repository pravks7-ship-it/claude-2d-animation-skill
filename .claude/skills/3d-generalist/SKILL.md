# 3D Generalist

Act as a complete 3D creative studio for content creators. Turn a story, an engineering premise, a historical case or an
everyday problem into human-crafted, anti-slop 3D content across **Blender**, **Three.js** and **67js**: vertical Shorts,
cutaway build films, 3D storytelling videos, interactive scenes and hero renders.

Paths use `{{WORK_DIR}}` for the project folder and `{{SKILL_DIR}}` for this skill's folder.

## Choose the mode and load only the references it needs

| Mode | What it makes | Read first |
|---|---|---|
| `cutaway` | A 60 s 3D perspective cutaway Short where one simple thing is built piece by piece through problem-and-fix rounds | `references/shorts-storytelling.md`, `references/worlds-and-cutaways.md`, `references/acting-and-motion.md`, `references/qa-and-gates.md` |
| `story` | A character-driven 3D storytelling Short or scene (kitbashed set, expressive face/head acting, slapstick beats, tracked camera) | `references/assets-and-kitbash.md`, `references/characters-and-rigs.md`, `references/acting-and-motion.md`, `references/camera-and-lighting.md` |
| `world` | A rich 3D environment or diorama with period details, scanned PBR materials, grass, water, fire and ambient life | `references/assets-and-kitbash.md`, `references/worlds-and-cutaways.md`, `references/camera-and-lighting.md`; shown as render, then clay model, then render: `references/clay-reveal.md` |
| `character` | A rigged 3D character (realistic worker, HumanGen or retro low-poly from a 2D reference) with retargeted clips, foot grounding and arm IK | `references/characters-and-rigs.md`, `references/acting-and-motion.md`, `../model-characters/SKILL.md` (when modeling from 2D art) |
| `asset` | A hero 3D model, kitbashed prop or reference-matched PBR material exported to GLB | `references/assets-and-kitbash.md` |

For any step done in Blender (geometry nodes, shaders, rigging, weight paint, NLA, bpy), load the `use-3d-software` skill for the exact nodes and current 5.x names. For the edit, captions, grade and export in any editor (Resolve, CapCut, Premiere, Kdenlive, FFmpeg), load `edit-video`.
Craft skills for single steps: `animate-characters` (keys, timing, cycles, acting in 2D and 3D), `rig-characters` (bones, weights, IK/FK, face rigs, engine export), `sculpt-models` (organic forms, creatures, rocks, terrain, retopo and bake), `draw-and-paint-art` (turnarounds, style frames, painted textures) and `paint-stylized-backgrounds` (backdrops, paint-over, parallax).
**Before building a look, pick the technique, not brute force:** `references/technique-atlas.md` maps a symptom (flat, CG, boxy, stiff, muddy) to the named pro technique, its numbers and its recipe; depth maths in `references/depth-parallax-and-atmosphere.md`. Machine paths (Krita, OpenToonz, Blender): `local.md` next to this file when it exists.

## Order of work: the production spine

Run the eight steps of `references/pipeline-spine.md` in order, in every mode. Each step writes its file into
`{{WORK_DIR}}` and its line under `## Progress` in `brief.md`; start a step only from the files of the one above it.
The user sees the work three times: the choice at step 4 (prep sheet, sketch and options), a WIP demo of the
first finished shot at step 6 (sent without waiting), and the preview at step 8. After the preview the user's
answer picks the next round: fix, continue in a direction, or "you decide" free creative mode (spine, last section). The spine says
which steps shrink per mode.

| Step | Writes | 3D rules for the step |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Brief | `brief.md` | `references/intent-brief.md`: five slots, at most 4 questions, then go |
| 2. Reference | `refs/`, `refs/NOTES.md` | two views per hero subject, real footage for place, light and weather; real CC0 / CC BY assets before primitives: `references/assets-and-kitbash.md` |
| 3. Script and beats | `script.md`, beat table, scratch voice, cue list | hook at 0 to 3 s with the picture already moving, 5 to 7 `But <failure> -> So <fix>` rounds, a flip, a stress test, a closer, sources on top: `references/shorts-storytelling.md` |
| 4. Prep and look gate | `plan.md` (sketch, tools checked, resources downloaded), style frames A/B/C, grey blockout or animatic with real cameras, then `LOOK.md`, `cameras.json` | the user picks; `references/technique-atlas.md` picks the technique, `references/camera-and-lighting.md` the light, `references/clay-reveal.md` the clay pass |
| 5. Assets and check | `assets/`, `CREDITS.md`, measured bounds | fit on real vertex bounds (`Box3.setFromObject(model, true)`), scale the world to the character, no clipping at shot distance: `references/assets-and-kitbash.md`, `references/characters-and-rigs.md` |
| 6. Build and animate | shots, WIP demo after the first | one continuous dressed set with ambient life, cutaway by section plane: `references/worlds-and-cutaways.md`; head leads turns 4 to 6 frames, staggered stops, anticipation, physics baked so every frame is `f(t)`: `references/acting-and-motion.md`; under 1 hard cut per 10 s, camera keys 5 to 8 frames apart, spine fill light, DoF on the subject, 6-subframe 180-degree blur, then bloom, vignette and grain as `LOOK.md` sets them: `references/camera-and-lighting.md`; drawn FX: `references/hybrid-2d-3d-fx.md` |
| 7. Sound | final voice, SFX, music, mix | `design-sound`: tail silences over 0.12 s trimmed, one-word captions within ±0.05 s, a soft real SFX for every visible event, -14 LUFS |
| 8. QA, preview, final | gate report, 540p preview with sound | every gate in `references/qa-and-gates.md` (contact and slip: `scripts/check_contact_and_slip.mjs`; Blender frame fill and floating props: `scripts/blender_frame_audit.py`; look match: `scripts/compare_look.py`; sheets: `scripts/contact-sheet.sh`), then the user approves the preview before the full render |

## Hard anti-slop rules

- **Nothing floats, ever:** every foot, knee, stone, prop and structure sits within 1 to 2 cm of the real mesh surface
  under it, with visible support in day or night shots.
- **No event without a visible cause:** doors, levers, buckets, fires and blocks move only when a hand or physical force
  touches them. Hands sit within 3 cm of the gripped surface with low, natural elbows.
- **No teleporting or foot skating:** characters walk every move at stride speed (under 1.8 m/s) through real openings,
  pivot on the balls of the feet, and end walks at walls or seats with feet together.
- **Detail by the cheapest method that reads:** model only what the camera reads as a silhouette. Gravel, grass
  fields, brick, tiles, dirt and far crowds come from a scanned PBR set, displacement, scattered instances or
  alpha cards, never thousands of modelled pieces. Ladder and examples:
  `references/assets-and-kitbash.md`, "Detail ladder".
- **Nothing boxy, nothing repeated:** bevel edges, break silhouettes, jitter every copy (scale, rotation, tint),
  hide texture tiling, stagger and vary every group motion. Rules:
  `references/assets-and-kitbash.md`, "Variation and imperfection".
- **Clean enters and exits:** nothing pops on or vanishes in 1 frame. Every prop, flow arrow and 3D leader-line label
  animates in and animates out the way it came, and everything from an old beat leaves when the beat ends.
